Manipulate LLVM assembly from Nvidia CUDA Kernels

Installation

  This tool is implemented as an LLVM compiler pass (see [1]).  It is
  built using the LLVM cmake machinery [2], and requires that LLVM was
  installed with cmake.  However, this does *not* require access to
  the LLVM source tree.

  The cuda branch follows the most recent LLVM developement and 
  requires at least LLVM-11 to build. Please refer to LLVM apt website
  for how to install the nightly LLVM package into your system before
  proceeding to compile this project. 

  Run the following to build and install llvm-mutate.

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install
